# TileVania

Welcome to **TileVania**, a classic 2D platformer game built with **Unity**!  
This project is part of my learning journey in Unity 2D development, focusing on creating polished platformer mechanics, tilemap-based level design, and player interaction with the environment.

## 🎮 Features

- **2D Platformer Mechanics**:  
  Smooth player movement, jumping, and collision handling.
  
- **Tilemap-Based World**:  
  Design beautiful levels easily using Unity’s built-in Tilemap system.
  
- **Collectibles**:  
  Coins or items scattered throughout the world that the player can collect.
  
- **Hazards and Traps**:  
  Dangerous elements (e.g., enemies, spikes) that challenge the player.
  
- **Respawn and Death System**:  
  Player respawns at the last checkpoint or starting point when defeated.

- **Simple Animation System**:  
  Character animations for idle, running, jumping, and dying states.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Unity 2022 (or newer)
- C# (for game logic and scripting)
- Unity Tilemap System
- Unity Animator for simple 2D animations

## ✨ Screenshots

*(You can add screenshots of gameplay here if available.)*

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Practice building a small but complete 2D game.
- Understand Unity's Tilemap and Collider system.
- Manage animations and character states.
- Handle simple player death, respawn, and collectibles.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Add more levels and more complex level design.
- Add enemies with basic AI.
- Create a main menu and game over screen.
- Polish animations and add visual effects (particles, transitions).

Would you like me to also suggest a **fancier version** (with badges, preview GIFs, etc.) if you want your GitHub page to look even more polished? 🚀  
Would you also like me to help you create a *todo list* inside the README if you plan to keep working on it? 🎯
